name: Enhanced Salvage Of Destroyed Parts
desc: >-
  This mod overrides the game's yes/no setting for whether destroyed parts should be salvageable with a 50% chance.


  To adjust that probability:


  In the game's logs etc directory:

  AppData\LocalLow\Brace Yourself Games\Phantom Brigade


  Launch the game and it will create file: enhanced_salvage_of_destroyed_parts_config.json


  Below is an example content for this file (the {} curly-braces and everything inside them).

  A value of 0.75 represents 75% for a part to be salvageable after it is destroyed. You can edit this file to change this value to anything between 0.00 to 1.00.

      {
          "salvageable_destroyed_part_success_chance": 0.75
      }
